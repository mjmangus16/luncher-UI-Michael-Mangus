          <p>
            Luncher is a program that helps provide lunches to schools. Not
            every student has access to the funds needed to make sure they have
            lunch everyday. No child deserves to go hungry. We make sure no one
            will!

          <p>
            The Luncher app connects schools with the donations they need to
            provide enough lunches for all students. Once your school is
            registered in our app, potential donators can see exactly how much
            funds your school needs.

        <h2>Students Who Eat Lunch Perform Better In School</h2>
        <div class="why-content">
          <p>
            Lunch is a more important part of a students day than it gets credit
            for. It has been scientifically proven that students perform better
            in school when they are able to eat lunch. It is important to make
            sure EVERY student is given the opportunity to perform their very
            best!
